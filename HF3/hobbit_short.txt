Baggins would say on any question without the bother of asking him. This is a story of how a Baggins had an adventure, found himself doing and saying things altogether unexpected.

WordCount: 22
I suppose hobbits need some description nowadays, since they have become rare and shy of the Big People, as they call us.

WordCount: 32
Belladonna Took, one of the three remarkable daughters of the Old Took, head of the hobbits who lived across The Water, the small river that ran at the foot of The Hill.

WordCount: 28
They discreetly disappeared, and the family hushed it up; but the fact remained that the Tooks were not as respectable as the Bagginses, though they were undoubtedly richer.

WordCount: 35
Do you wish me a good morning, or mean that it is a good morning whether I want not; or that you feel good this morning; or that it is morning to be good on?

WordCount: 31
And a very fine morning for a pipe of tobacco out of doors, into the bargain. If you have a pipe about you, sit down and have a fill of mine!

WordCount: 36
Then Bilbo sat down on a seat by his door, crossed his legs, and blew out a beautiful grey ring of smoke that sailed up into the air without breaking and floated away over The Hill.

WordCount: 20
We are plain quiet folk and have no use for adventures. Nasty .disturbing uncomfortable things! Make you late for dinner!

WordCount: 37
Then he took out his morning letters, and begin to read, pretending to take no more notice of the old man. He had decided that he was not quite his sort, and wanted him to go away.

WordCount: 31
But the old man did not move. He stood leaning on his stick and gazing at the hobbit without saying anything, till Bilbo got quite uncomfortable and even a little cross.

WordCount: 28
Gandalf, Gandalf! Good gracious me! Not the wandering wizard that gave Old Took a pair of magic diamond studs that fastened themselves and never came undone till ordered?

WordCount: 30
Not the fellow who used to tell such wonderful tales at parties, about dragons and goblins and giants and the rescue of princesses and the unexpected luck of widows' sons?

WordCount: 23
Not the man that used to make such particularly excellent fireworks! I remember those! Old Took used to have them on Midsummer's Eve.

WordCount: 22
Splendid! They used to go up like great lilies and snapdragons and laburnums of fire and hang in the twilight all evening!

WordCount: 25
You will notice already that Mr. Baggins was not quite so prosy as he liked to believe, also that he was very fond of flowers.

WordCount: 29
I mean, you used to upset things badly in these parts once upon a time. I beg your pardon, but I had no idea you were still in business.

WordCount: 29
All the same I am pleased to find you remember something about me. You seem to remember my fireworks kindly, at any rate, land that is not without hope.

WordCount: 24
With that the hobbit turned and scuttled inside his round green door, and shut it as quickly as he dared, not to seen rude.

WordCount: 26
He had only just had break fast, but he thought a cake or two and a drink of something would do him good after his fright.

WordCount: 32
A little stiff perhaps, but he meant it kindly. And what would you do, if an uninvited dwarf came and hung his things up in your hall without a word of explanation?

WordCount: 26
They had not been at table long, in fact they had hardly reached the third cake, when there came another even louder ring at the bell.

WordCount: 25
Bilbo plumped down the beer and the cake in front of them, when loud came a ring at the bell again, and then another ring.

WordCount: 30
But it was not. It was two more dwarves, both with blue hoods, silver belts, and yellow beards; and each of them carried a bag of tools and a spade.

WordCount: 35
The poor little hobbit sat down in the hall and put his head in his hands, and wondered what had happened, and what was going to happen, and whether they would all stay to supper.

WordCount: 37
Then the bell rang again louder than ever, and he had to run to the door. It was not four after all, t was FIVE. Another dwarf had come along while he was wondering in the hall.

WordCount: 35
Already it had almost become a throng. Some called for ale, and some for porter, and one for coffee, and all of them for cakes; so the hobbit was kept very busy for a while.

WordCount: 27
Wednesday he ever remembered. He pulled open the door with a jerk, and they all fell in, one on top of the other. More dwarves, four more!

WordCount: 22
For one thing Bombur was immensely fat and heavy. Thorin indeed was very haughty, and said nothing about service; but poor Mr.

WordCount: 24
Mr. Baggins, who was feeling positively flummoxed, and was beginning to wonder whether a most wretched adventure had not come right into his house.

WordCount: 31
The dwarves ate and ate, and talked and talked, and time got on. At last they pushed their chairs back, and Bilbo made a move to collect the plates and glasses.

WordCount: 29
Smash the bottles and burn the corks! Cut the cloth and tread on the fat! Pour the milk on the pantry floor! Leave the bones on the bedroom mat!

WordCount: 36
Splash the wine on every door! Dump the crocks in a boiling bawl; Pound them up with a thumping pole; And when you've finished, if any are whole, Send them down the hall to roll !

WordCount: 25
Far over the misty mountains cold To dungeons deep and caverns old We must away ere break of day To seek the pale enchanted gold.

WordCount: 26
The dwarves of yore made mighty spells, While hammers fell like ringing bells In places deep, where dark things sleep, In hollow halls beneath the fells.

WordCount: 28
For ancient king and elvish lord There many a gloaming golden hoard They shaped and wrought, and light they caught To hide in gems on hilt of sword.

WordCount: 29
Goblets they carved there for themselves And harps of gold; where no man delves There lay they long, and many a song Was sung unheard by men or elves.

WordCount: 28
The dragon's ire more fierce than fire Laid low their towers and houses frail. The mountain smoked beneath the moon; The dwarves, they heard the tramp of doom.

WordCount: 33
Beneath his feet, beneath the moon. Far over the misty mountains grim To dungeons deep and caverns dim We must away, ere break of day, To win our harps and gold from him!

WordCount: 35
As they sang the hobbit felt the love of beautiful things made by hands and by cunning and by magic moving through him, a fierce and jealous love, the desire of the hearts of dwarves.

WordCount: 29
He looked out of the window. The stars were out in a dark sky above the trees. He thought of the jewels of the dwarves shining in dark caverns.

WordCount: 24
Suddenly he found that the music and the singing had stopped, and they were all looking at him with eyes shining in the dark.

WordCount: 25
Bilbo, and sat down in a hurry. He missed the stool and sat in the fender, knocking over the poker and shovel with a crash.

WordCount: 28
Bilbo Baggins, who was wagging his mouth in protest at being called audacious and worst of all fellow conspirator, though no noise came out, he was so flummoxed.

WordCount: 32
It sailed a hundred yards through the air and went down a rabbit hole, and in this way the battle was won and the game of Golf invented at the same moment.

WordCount: 34
I think it sounded more like fright than excitement! In fact, if it bad not been for the sign on the door, I should have been sure we had come to the wrong house.

WordCount: 28
Then Mr. Baggins turned the handle and went in. The Took side had won. He suddenly felt he would go without bed and breakfast to be thought fierce.

WordCount: 24
I put it there myself. For very good reasons. You asked me to find the fourteenth man for your expedition, and I chose Mr.

WordCount: 35
Baggins. Just let any one say I chose the wrong man or the wrong house, and you can stop at thirteen and have all the bad luck you like, or go back to digging coal.

WordCount: 39
If I say he is a Burglar, a Burglar he is, or will be when the time comes. There is a lot more in him than you guess, and a deal more than he has any idea of himself.

WordCount: 26
I remember the Mountain well enough and the lands about it. And I know where Mirkwood is, and the Withered Heath where the great dragons bred.

WordCount: 29
So far we have had no clear idea what to do. We thought of going East, as quiet and careful as we could, as far as the Long Lake.

WordCount: 32
Warrior, even a Hero. I tried to find one; but warriors are busy fighting one another in distant lands, and in this neighbourhood heroes are scarce, or simply lot to be found.

WordCount: 23
And here is our little Bilbo Baggins, the burglar, the chosen and selected burglar. So now let's get on and make some plans.

WordCount: 32
Long ago in my grandfather Thror's time our family was driven out of the far North, and came back with all their wealth and their tools to this Mountain on the map.

WordCount: 26
They built the merry town of Dale there in those days. Kings used to send for our smiths, and reward even the least skilful most richly.

WordCount: 28
Altogether those were good days for us, and the poorest of us had money to spend and to lend, and leisure to make beautiful things just for the.

WordCount: 31
By that time all the bells were ringing in Dale and the warriors were arming. The dwarves rushed out of their great gate; but there was the dragon waiting for them.

WordCount: 26
Then he went back and crept in through the Front Gate and routed out all the halls, and lanes, and tunnels, alleys, cellars, mansions and passages.

WordCount: 35
Later he used to crawl out of the great gate and come by night to Dale, and carry away people, especially maidens, to eat, until Dale was ruined, and all the people dead or gone.

WordCount: 31
The few of us that were well outside sat and wept in hiding, and cursed Smaug; and there we were unexpectedly joined by my father and my grandfather with singed beards.

WordCount: 36
They looked very grim but they said very little. When I asked how they had got away, they told me to hold my tongue, and said that one day in the proper time I should know.

WordCount: 30
But apparently they made a map, and I should like to know how Gandalf got hold of it, and why it did not come down to me, the rightful heir.

WordCount: 38
I had to find you. Your father could not remember his own name when he gave me the paper, and he never told me yours; so on the whole I think I ought to be praised and thanked.

WordCount: 35
Moria. Your father went away to try his luck with the map after your grandfather was killed; and lots of adventures of a most unpleasant sort he had, but he never got near the Mountain.

WordCount: 23
Never you mind. I was finding things out, as usual; and a nasty dangerous business it was. Even I, Gandalf, only just escaped.

WordCount: 27
I tried to save your father, but it was too late. He was witless and wandering, and had forgotten almost everything except the map and the key.

WordCount: 31
Don't be absurd! He is an enemy quite beyond the powers of all the dwarves put together, if they could all be collected again from the four corners of the world.

WordCount: 31
The one thing your father wished was for his son to read the map and use the key. The dragon and the Mountain are more than big enough tasks for you!

WordCount: 24
One thing he did make his mind up about was not to bother to get up very early and cook everybody else's wretched breakfast.

WordCount: 28
Bilbo went to sleep with that in his ears, and it gave him very uncomfortable dreams. It was long after the break of day, when he woke up.

WordCount: 30
There he saw nobody, but all the signs of a large and hurried breakfast. There was a fearful mess in the room, and piles of unwashed crocks in the kitchen.

WordCount: 31
By that time the sun was shining; and the front door was open, letting in a warm spring breeze. Bilbo began to whistle loudly and to forget about the night before.

WordCount: 23
Thorin and Company to Burglar Bilbo greeting! For your hospitality our sincerest thanks, and for your offer of professional assistance our grateful acceptance.

WordCount: 32
Gandalf's hands, and running as fast as his furry feet could carry him down the lane, past the great Mill, across The Water, and then on for a whole mile or more.

WordCount: 27
Balin who was standing at the inn door looking out for him. Just then all the others came round the corner of the road from the village.

WordCount: 28
They were on ponies, and each pony was slung about with all kinds of baggages, packages, parcels, and paraphernalia. There was a very small pony, apparently for Bilbo.

WordCount: 24
Dwalin. They were too large for him, and he looked rather comic. What his father Bungo would have thought of him, I daren't think.

WordCount: 33
His only comfort was he couldn't be mistaken for a dwarf, as he had no beard. They had not been riding very long when up came Gandalf very splendid on a white horse.

WordCount: 26
These didn't come quite as often as Bilbo would have liked them, but still he began to feel that adventures were not so bad after all.

WordCount: 33
Not far ahead were dreary hills, rising higher and higher, dark with trees. On some of them were old castles with an evil look, as if they had been built by wicked people.

WordCount: 34
Everything seemed gloomy, for the weather that day had taken a nasty turn. Mostly it had been as good as May can be, even in merry tales, but now it was cold and wet.

WordCount: 28
Bother burgling and everything to do with it! I wish I was at home in my nice hole by the fire, with the kettle just beginning to sing!

WordCount: 25
It was not the last time that he wished that! Still the dwarves jogged on, never turning round or taking any notice of the hobbit.

WordCount: 32
I don't know what river it was, a rushing red one, swollen with the rains of the last few days, that came down from the hills and mountains in front of them.

WordCount: 24
Soon it was nearly dark. The winds broke up the grey clouds, and a waning moon appeared above the hills between the flying rags.

WordCount: 36
Not until then did they notice that Gandalf was missing. So far he had come all the way with them, never saying if he was in the adventure or merely keeping them company for a while.

WordCount: 29
They moved to a clump of trees, and though it was drier under them, the wind shook the rain off the leaves, and the drip, drip, was most annoying.

WordCount: 23
Some said they could but go and see, and anything was better than little supper, less breakfast, and wet clothes all the night.

WordCount: 28
They have seldom even heard of the king round here, and the less inquisitive you are as you go along, the less trouble you are likely to find.

WordCount: 23
This remark was repeated by everybody. Then the rain began to pour down worse than ever, and Oin and Gloin began to fight.

WordCount: 28
Off Bilbo had to go, before he could explain that he could not hoot even once like any kind of owl any more than fly like a bat.

WordCount: 22
They were toasting mutton on long spits of wood, and licking the gravy off their fingers. There was a fine toothsome smell.

WordCount: 23
Also there was a barrel of good drink at hand, and they were drinking out of jugs. But they were trolls. Obviously trolls.

WordCount: 33
Yer can't expect folk to stop here for ever just to be et by you and Bert. You've et a village and a half between yer, since we come down from the mountains.

WordCount: 35
He took a big bite off a sheep's leg he was toasting, and wiped his lips on his sleeve. Yes, I am afraid trolls do behave like that, even those with only one head each.

WordCount: 22
Others more practical but with less professional pride would perhaps have stuck a dagger into each of them before they observed it.

WordCount: 25
Then the night could have been spent cheerily. Bilbo knew it. He had read of a good many things he had never seen or done.

WordCount: 27
Bert and Tom went off to the barrel. William was having another drink. Then Bilbo plucked up courage and put his little hand in William's enormous pocket.

WordCount: 27
I cook, if you see what I mean. I'll cook beautifully for you, a perfectly beautiful breakfast for you, if only you won't have me for supper.

WordCount: 26
Bilbo to come back, or to hoot like an owl, they started off one by one to creep towards the light as quietly as they could.
