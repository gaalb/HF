It had a perfectly round door like a porthole, painted green, with a shiny yellow brass knob in the exact middle.

WordCount: 31
Baggins would say on any question without the bother of asking him. This is a story of how a Baggins had an adventure, found himself doing and saying things altogether unexpected.

WordCount: 22
I suppose hobbits need some description nowadays, since they have become rare and shy of the Big People, as they call us.

WordCount: 49
Dwarves. Hobbits have no beards. There is little or no magic about them, except the ordinary everyday sort which helps them to disappear quietly and quickly when large stupid folk like you and me come blundering along, making a noise like elephants which they can hear a mile off.

WordCount: 32
Belladonna Took, one of the three remarkable daughters of the Old Took, head of the hobbits who lived across The Water, the small river that ran at the foot of The Hill.

WordCount: 28
They discreetly disappeared, and the family hushed it up; but the fact remained that the Tooks were not as respectable as the Bagginses, though they were undoubtedly richer.

WordCount: 67
The Hill or over The Hill or across The Water, and there they remained to the end of their days. Still it is probable that Bilbo, her only son, although he looked and behaved exactly like a second edition of his solid and comfortable father, got something a bit queer in his makeup from the Took side, something that only waited for a chance to come out.

WordCount: 42
Gandalf came by. Gandalf! If you had heard only a quarter of what I have heard about him, and I have only heard very little of all there is to hear, you would be prepared for any sort I of remarkable tale.

WordCount: 17
Tales and adventures sprouted up all over the place wherever he went, in the most extraordinary fashion.

WordCount: 34
He had not been down that way under The Hill for ages and ages, not since his friend the Old Took died, in fact, and the hobbits had almost forgotten what he looked like.

WordCount: 43
All that the unsuspecting Bilbo saw that morning was an old man with a staff. He had a tall pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak, a silver scarf over which a white beard hung down below his waist, and immense black boots.

WordCount: 36
Bilbo, and he meant it. The sun was shining, and the grass was very green. But Gandalf looked at him from under long bushy eyebrows that stuck out further than the brim of his shady hat.

WordCount: 35
Do you wish me a good morning, or mean that it is a good morning whether I want not; or that you feel good this morning; or that it is morning to be good on?

WordCount: 31
And a very fine morning for a pipe of tobacco out of doors, into the bargain. If you have a pipe about you, sit down and have a fill of mine!

WordCount: 36
Then Bilbo sat down on a seat by his door, crossed his legs, and blew out a beautiful grey ring of smoke that sailed up into the air without breaking and floated away over The Hill.

WordCount: 21
I am looking for someone to share in an adventure that I am arranging, and it's very difficult to find anyone.

WordCount: 20
We are plain quiet folk and have no use for adventures. Nasty .disturbing uncomfortable things! Make you late for dinner!

WordCount: 21
Then he took out his morning letters, and begin to read, pretending to take no more notice of the old man.

WordCount: 23
He had decided that he was not quite his sort, and wanted him to go away. But the old man did not move.

WordCount: 24
He stood leaning on his stick and gazing at the hobbit without saying anything, till Bilbo got quite uncomfortable and even a little cross.

WordCount: 23
I do know your name, Mr. Bilbo Baggins. And you do know my name, though you don't remember that I belong to it.

WordCount: 28
Gandalf, Gandalf! Good gracious me! Not the wandering wizard that gave Old Took a pair of magic diamond studs that fastened themselves and never came undone till ordered?

WordCount: 30
Not the fellow who used to tell such wonderful tales at parties, about dragons and goblins and giants and the rescue of princesses and the unexpected luck of widows' sons?

WordCount: 23
Not the man that used to make such particularly excellent fireworks! I remember those! Old Took used to have them on Midsummer's Eve.

WordCount: 22
Splendid! They used to go up like great lilies and snapdragons and laburnums of fire and hang in the twilight all evening!

WordCount: 25
You will notice already that Mr. Baggins was not quite so prosy as he liked to believe, also that he was very fond of flowers.

WordCount: 21
Not the Gandalf who was responsible for so many quiet lads and lasses going off into the Blue for mad adventures.

WordCount: 29
I mean, you used to upset things badly in these parts once upon a time. I beg your pardon, but I had no idea you were still in business.

WordCount: 29
All the same I am pleased to find you remember something about me. You seem to remember my fireworks kindly, at any rate, land that is not without hope.

WordCount: 25
Yes, you have! Twice now. My pardon. I give it you. In fact I will go so far as to send you on this adventure.

WordCount: 24
With that the hobbit turned and scuttled inside his round green door, and shut it as quickly as he dared, not to seen rude.

WordCount: 26
He had only just had break fast, but he thought a cake or two and a drink of something would do him good after his fright.

WordCount: 25
He rushed and put on the kettle, and put out another cup and saucer and an extra cake or two, and ran to the door.

WordCount: 32
A little stiff perhaps, but he meant it kindly. And what would you do, if an uninvited dwarf came and hung his things up in your hall without a word of explanation?

WordCount: 26
They had not been at table long, in fact they had hardly reached the third cake, when there came another even louder ring at the bell.

WordCount: 22
Bilbo with a gasp. It was not the correct thing to say, but they have begun to arrive had flustered him badly.

WordCount: 19
He liked visitors, but he liked to know them before they arrived, and he preferred to ask them himself.

WordCount: 25
Bilbo plumped down the beer and the cake in front of them, when loud came a ring at the bell again, and then another ring.

WordCount: 30
But it was not. It was two more dwarves, both with blue hoods, silver belts, and yellow beards; and each of them carried a bag of tools and a spade.

WordCount: 23
I don't like the sound of that. I really must sit down for a minute and collect my wits, and have a drink.

WordCount: 35
The poor little hobbit sat down in the hall and put his head in his hands, and wondered what had happened, and what was going to happen, and whether they would all stay to supper.

WordCount: 25
Then the bell rang again louder than ever, and he had to run to the door. It was not four after all, t was FIVE.

WordCount: 35
Already it had almost become a throng. Some called for ale, and some for porter, and one for coffee, and all of them for cakes; so the hobbit was kept very busy for a while.

WordCount: 23
Wednesday he ever remembered. He pulled open the door with a jerk, and they all fell in, one on top of the other.

WordCount: 44
More dwarves, four more! And there was Gandalf behind, leaning on his staff and laughing. He had made quite a dent on the beautiful door; he had also, by the way, knocked out the secret mark that he had put there the morning before.

WordCount: 40
This last belonged to Thorin, an enormously important dwarf, in fact no other than the great Thorin Oakenshield himself, who was not at all pleased at falling flat on Bilbo's mat with Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur on top of him.

WordCount: 22
For one thing Bombur was immensely fat and heavy. Thorin indeed was very haughty, and said nothing about service; but poor Mr.

WordCount: 24
Mr. Baggins, who was feeling positively flummoxed, and was beginning to wonder whether a most wretched adventure had not come right into his house.

WordCount: 40
By the time he had got all the bottles and dishes and knives and forks and glasses and plates and spoons and things piled up on big trays, he was getting very hot, and red in the face, and annoyed.

WordCount: 45
Lo and behold! there stood Balin and Dwalin at the door of the kitchen, and Fili and Kili behind them, and before he could say knife they had whisked the trays and a couple of small tables into the parlour and set out everything afresh.

WordCount: 31
The dwarves ate and ate, and talked and talked, and time got on. At last they pushed their chairs back, and Bilbo made a move to collect the plates and glasses.

WordCount: 21
And after. We shan't get through the business till late, and we must have some music first. Now to clear up!

WordCount: 22
Smash the bottles and burn the corks! Cut the cloth and tread on the fat! Pour the milk on the pantry floor!

WordCount: 36
Splash the wine on every door! Dump the crocks in a boiling bawl; Pound them up with a thumping pole; And when you've finished, if any are whole, Send them down the hall to roll !

WordCount: 54
That's what Bilbo Baggins hates! So, carefully! carefully with the plates! And of course they did none of these dreadful things, and everything was cleaned and put away safe as quick as lightning, while the hobbit was turning round and round in the middle of the kitchen trying to see what they were doing.

WordCount: 22
He had quite a cloud of them about him already, and in the dim light it made him look strange and sorcerous.

WordCount: 21
The dark filled all the room, and the fire died down, and the shadows were lost, and still they played on.

WordCount: 25
Far over the misty mountains cold To dungeons deep and caverns old We must away ere break of day To seek the pale enchanted gold.

WordCount: 26
The dwarves of yore made mighty spells, While hammers fell like ringing bells In places deep, where dark things sleep, In hollow halls beneath the fells.

WordCount: 28
For ancient king and elvish lord There many a gloaming golden hoard They shaped and wrought, and light they caught To hide in gems on hilt of sword.

WordCount: 29
Goblets they carved there for themselves And harps of gold; where no man delves There lay they long, and many a song Was sung unheard by men or elves.

WordCount: 28
The dragon's ire more fierce than fire Laid low their towers and houses frail. The mountain smoked beneath the moon; The dwarves, they heard the tramp of doom.

WordCount: 33
Beneath his feet, beneath the moon. Far over the misty mountains grim To dungeons deep and caverns dim We must away, ere break of day, To win our harps and gold from him!

WordCount: 35
As they sang the hobbit felt the love of beautiful things made by hands and by cunning and by magic moving through him, a fierce and jealous love, the desire of the hearts of dwarves.

WordCount: 29
He looked out of the window. The stars were out in a dark sky above the trees. He thought of the jewels of the dwarves shining in dark caverns.

WordCount: 49
Hill, again. He got up trembling. He had less than half a mind to fetch the lamp, and more than half a mind to pretend to, and go and hide behind the beer barrels in the cellar, and not come out again until all the dwarves had gone away.

WordCount: 24
Suddenly he found that the music and the singing had stopped, and they were all looking at him with eyes shining in the dark.

WordCount: 25
Bilbo, and sat down in a hurry. He missed the stool and sat in the fender, knocking over the poker and shovel with a crash.

WordCount: 28
Bilbo Baggins, who was wagging his mouth in protest at being called audacious and worst of all fellow conspirator, though no noise came out, he was so flummoxed.

WordCount: 39
This was Thorin's style. He was an important dwarf. If he had been allowed, he would probably have gone on like this until he was out of breath, without telling any one there 'anything that was not known already.

WordCount: 42
But he was rudely interrupted. Poor Bilbo couldn't bear it any longer. At may never return he began to feel a shriek coming up inside, and very soon it burst out like the whistle of an engine coming out of a tunnel.

WordCount: 32
It sailed a hundred yards through the air and went down a rabbit hole, and in this way the battle was won and the game of Golf invented at the same moment.

WordCount: 47
Will he do, do you think? It is all very well for Gandalf to talk about this hobbit being fierce, but one shriek like that in a moment of excitement would be enough to wake the dragon and all his relatives, and kill the lot of us.

WordCount: 34
I think it sounded more like fright than excitement! In fact, if it bad not been for the sign on the door, I should have been sure we had come to the wrong house.

WordCount: 28
Then Mr. Baggins turned the handle and went in. The Took side had won. He suddenly felt he would go without bed and breakfast to be thought fierce.

WordCount: 24
I put it there myself. For very good reasons. You asked me to find the fourteenth man for your expedition, and I chose Mr.

WordCount: 35
Baggins. Just let any one say I chose the wrong man or the wrong house, and you can stop at thirteen and have all the bad luck you like, or go back to digging coal.

WordCount: 47
He scowled so angrily at Gloin that the dwarf huddled back in his chair; and when Bilbo tried to open his mouth to ask a question, he turned and frowned at him and stuck oat his bushy eyebrows, till Bilbo shut his mouth tight with a snap.

WordCount: 39
If I say he is a Burglar, a Burglar he is, or will be when the time comes. There is a lot more in him than you guess, and a deal more than he has any idea of himself.

WordCount: 24
On the table in the light of a big lamp with a red shad he spread a piece of parchment rather like a map.

WordCount: 17
This was made by Thror, your grandfather, Thorin, he said in answer to the dwarves' excited questions.

WordCount: 26
I remember the Mountain well enough and the lands about it. And I know where Mirkwood is, and the Withered Heath where the great dragons bred.

WordCount: 49
Because it is too small. 'Five feet high the door and three may walk abreast' say the runes, but Smaug could not creep into a hole that size, not even when he was a young dragon, certainly not after devouring so many of the dwarves and men of Dale.

WordCount: 43
He was getting excited and interested again, so that he forgot to keep his mouth shut. He loved maps, and in his hall there hung a large one of the Country Round with all his favourite walks marked on it in red ink.

WordCount: 29
So far we have had no clear idea what to do. We thought of going East, as quiet and careful as we could, as far as the Long Lake.

WordCount: 32
Warrior, even a Hero. I tried to find one; but warriors are busy fighting one another in distant lands, and in this neighbourhood heroes are scarce, or simply lot to be found.

WordCount: 23
And here is our little Bilbo Baggins, the burglar, the chosen and selected burglar. So now let's get on and make some plans.

WordCount: 26
I mean about the gold and the dragon, and all that, and how it got there, and who it belongs to, and so on and further.

WordCount: 32
Long ago in my grandfather Thror's time our family was driven out of the far North, and came back with all their wealth and their tools to this Mountain on the map.

WordCount: 62
I believe they found a good deal of gold and a great many jewels too. Anyway they grew immensely rich and famous, and my grandfather was King under the Mountain again and treated with great reverence by the mortal men, who lived to the South, and were gradually spreading up the Running River as far as the valley overshadowed by the Mountain.

WordCount: 26
They built the merry town of Dale there in those days. Kings used to send for our smiths, and reward even the least skilful most richly.

WordCount: 28
Altogether those were good days for us, and the poorest of us had money to spend and to lend, and leisure to make beautiful things just for the.

WordCount: 42
Indeed they hardly know a good bit of work from a bad, though they usually have a good notion of the current market value; and they can't make a thing for themselves, not even mend a little loose scale of their armour.

WordCount: 42
There were lots of dragons in the North in those days, and gold was probably getting scarce up there, with the dwarves flying south or getting killed, and all the general waste and destruction that dragons make going from bad to worse.

WordCount: 23
There was a most specially greedy, strong and wicked worm called Smaug. One day he flew up into the air and came south.

WordCount: 31
By that time all the bells were ringing in Dale and the warriors were arming. The dwarves rushed out of their great gate; but there was the dragon waiting for them.

WordCount: 26
Then he went back and crept in through the Front Gate and routed out all the halls, and lanes, and tunnels, alleys, cellars, mansions and passages.

WordCount: 43
After that there were no dwarves left alive inside, and he took all their wealth for himself. Probably, for that is the dragons' way, he has piled it all up in a great heap far inside, and sleeps on it for a bed.

WordCount: 35
Later he used to crawl out of the great gate and come by night to Dale, and carry away people, especially maidens, to eat, until Dale was ruined, and all the people dead or gone.

WordCount: 31
The few of us that were well outside sat and wept in hiding, and cursed Smaug; and there we were unexpectedly joined by my father and my grandfather with singed beards.
